# 1) Write a Python program that takes two lists and returns True if they have at least one common member.

# l1 = [1,2,3,4]
# l2= [4,5,6,7]

# for i in l1:
# 	for x in l2:
# 		if i == x:
# 			print( f"The member {i} is common \n{l1} and {l2} lists ")




# 2)Write a Python program to print a specified list after removing the 0th, 4th and 5th elements

# l1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
# print(f"This is original list {l1} ")
# l1.pop(5)
# l1.pop(4)
# l1.pop(0)
# print(f"The list look like this {l1} after removing the 0th, 4th and 5th element")


# 3)Write a Python program to get the difference between the two lists

# l1 = ["Apple","Cherry","Orange"]
# l2 = ["Apple","Banana","Cherry"]


# for i in l1:
# 	for x in l2:
# 		if i not in l2 and x not in l1:
# 			print( f" {x} and {i} are the differences between the \n{l1} and {l2} lists ")




# 4) Write a Python program to find the second smallest number in a list.


# l1 = [4,3,8,5,6]
# l1.sort()
# print(l1[1],f"Is the second smallest number in {l1} list")


# 5)Getting the first three items of a list

# l1 = ["BMW","Ford","Toyota","Honda","Ferrari","Mercedez"]

# print(f"These are the first three items of a \n{l1} list" "1|",l1[0],"2|",l1[1],"3|",l1[2])


# 6)Write a Python program to remove duplicates from a list. 

# l1 = [1,4,4,5,8,5]
# without_dublicates = []
# for i in l1:
# 	if i not in without_dublicates:
# 		without_dublicates.append(i)
# print(f"The list look like this {without_dublicates} after \nremoving duplicates from list")
