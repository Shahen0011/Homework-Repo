# 1)Write a Python program to reverse a string.
# Sample String : "1234abcd"
# Expected Output : "dcba4321"

# def my_str(rev):
# 	res = sorted(rev, reverse=True)
# 	jo = "".join(res)
# 	return jo
# print(my_str("1234abcd"))	

# 2) Write a Python program that accepts a hyphen-separated sequence of words as input
# and prints the words in a hyphen-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically. 
# Sample Items : green-red-yellow-black-white
# Expected Result : black-green-red-white-yellow


# def alphabet(myStr):
# 	spl_ = myStr.split("-")
# 	sor = sorted(spl_)
# 	return "-".join(sor)
# print(alphabet("green-red-yellow-black-white"))

# 3)Write a Python program to print the floating numbers up to 2 decimal places	

# def function(a):
	
# 	fo_ = "{:.2f}".format(a)
# 	return fo_

# print(function(3.456))

# 4)Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). Ask the user to guess the number,
# then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right.



# 5)Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number.
# (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number.
# For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

# def my_Math():
# 	num = int(input("Enter an integer"))
# 	for i in range(1, num + 1):
# 		if num % i == 0:
# 			print((i))
# 	print(f"These are the all divisor for {num}  ")

# my_Math()
