# 1)Given is a nested tuple. Write a program to modify the first item (22) of a list inside a following tuple to 222
# example:tuple1 = (11, [22, 33], 44, 55)
# output:tuple1 = (11, [222, 33], 44, 55)


# tuple1 = (11, [22, 33], 44, 55)
# remove_items = tuple1[1].pop(0)
# add_ittems = tuple1[1].insert(0, "222")
# print(tuple1)

# 2)Write a Python program convert a given string list to a tuple.
# Original string: python 3.0
# <class 'str'>
# Convert the said string to a tuple:
# ('p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n', '3', '.', '0')

# my_str = input("Enter your string")
# print(tuple(my_str))

# 3)Check if all items in the tuple are the same

# my_tuple = (1,1,1,1)
# if my_tuple.count(my_tuple[0]) == len(my_tuple):
# 	print(f"All items is the same in {my_tuple}  ")
# else: 
# 	print(f"All items is not the same in {my_tuple} ")

# 4)Get the maximum and minimum values for set without max() and min() and without cast to list.

# my_se = {20,500,30,40}
# arrange = sorted(my_se)
# print(f"Maximum and minimum value for {my_se} \nmin is {arrange[0]} max is {arrange[-1]} ")

# 5)Write a Python program to check if two given sets have no elements in common.

# my_se = {1,2,3}
# my_se1 = {3,4,5}

# diff = my_se.isdisjoint(my_se1)
# if diff == False:
# 	print(f" {my_se} and {my_se1} have common elements ")
# elif diff == True:
# 	print(f" {my_se} and {my_se1} have not common elements ")

# 6)Write a Python program to convert a tuple to a string.

# my_tup = (1,2,3,4)
# print(str(my_tup))


# 7)Write a Python program to convert a tuple of string values to a tuple of integer values.
# Original tuple values:
# (('333', '33'), ('1416', '55'))
# New tuple values:
# ((333, 33), (1416, 55))
